<p align="center"> Researcher in Robotics and Control Systems</p>

## Profile

<p align="justify">I received the Bachelor of Engineering degree from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. During my undergraduate study, I was firstly involved in the project of battery-pack management system of national electric car. After the project completed, I joined the UAV formation control research group. I was responsible for designing a simple formation control algorithm using the well-known potential field method which, in the end of my study, also became my bachelor thesis. Those results have been published on IEEE and MEV Journal.

<p align="justify">After finishing my undergraduate study, I took the doctoral degree in the field of control systems at The University of Manchester under the supervision of Professor Zhengtao Ding. My doctoral study was supported by Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP), Indonesia. Aligning with my bachelor thesis, I did a research on the distributed coordination and estimation algorithms of robotic sensor networks. I designed distributed algorithms to solve the motion control of robots whose objective was to solve coverage control problem in unknown environment via distributed optimisation and Kalman-based estimation. While focusing on my own research project, I also did collaboration to work on bearing-based formation control, affine formation control, and fixed-time formation control. The results have been published in the journals by IEEE and Elsevier.</p>

<p align="justify">Following the completion of my doctoral study, I was involved in the development of a Otaklebah middleware to operate multiple UAVs for various purposes in a startup company, Beehive Drones. I was also involved in the project of Navier Delivery Systems aiming to build a website-application-based delivery systems with Hybrid VTOL plane.</p>

<p align="justify">During 2021, I became a postdoctoral researcher in the COntrol, PErception, Robots, Navigation and Intelligent Computing (COPERNIC) group at (Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique) GIPSA Lab, France, a joint research unit of CNRS, Grenoble INP and University of Grenoble-Alpes. My current research aligned with my previous research topics, where I focused on the trajectory generation and tracking techniques of multiple quadcopters.</p>

<p align="justify">From January 2022, I am appointed as a postdoctoral researcher in the Geomatics Section of Faculty Engineering Technology, KU Leuven, Belgium (<a href="https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/geomatics">Geomatics Section</a>). I am currently working on the Deep Sewer project aiming to develop a robot for automatic mapping and inspection of sewer networks.</p>
