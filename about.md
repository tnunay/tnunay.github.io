<p align="center"> Researcher in Control Systems</p>

## Biography

<p align="justify">I started studying Electrical Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at
Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia, as a bachelor student. During my study, I was involved in several research projects including battery-pack management system in the national project of electric car. After the project finished, I became the member of UAV research group. I was responsible for designing simple formation control algorithm using the well-known potential field method which, in the end of my study, also became part of my bachelor thesis. I have published several papers on IEEE and MEV Journal based on the result of the project I participated in.

<p align="justify">After finishing my undergraduate study, I took my doctoral degree in the field of control systems at The University of Manchester under the supervision of Professor Zhengtao Ding, and supported by Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education, Ministry of Finance, Indonesia. I did a research on the coordination of robotic sensor networks. From this topic, I am designing distributed algorithms to solve the motion control, coverage control, optimisation and filtering problems in a sensor network.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2015, when I was in the application process for LPDP scholarship, I told the interviewers that someday, after I finish my PhD, I will apply my research about robotics coordination systems to help people in Indonesia. To actualise this promise, while pursuing my PhD, I also collaborate with some colleagues co-founding a startup company which aims to implement the formation control algorithm to a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to help people execute their daily tasks. The startup company we are currently working on is <a href="http://www.bvdrones.com/">Beehive Drones</a>.</p>
