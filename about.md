## Biography

<p align="justify">I started studying Electrical Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at
Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia, as a bachelor student. During my study, I was involved in several research projects including battery-pack management system in the national project of electric car. After the project finished, I became the member of UAV research group. I was responsible for designing simple formation control algorithm using the well-known potential field method which, in the end of my study, also became part of my bachelor thesis. I have published several papers on IEEE and MEV Journal based on the result of the project I participated in.

<p align="justify">After finishing my undergraduate study, I am currently pursue my doctoral degree in the field of control systems at The University of Manchester under the supervision of Professor Zhengtao Ding. I am doing a research on the coordination of robotic sensor networks. From this topic, I am designing distributed algorithms to solve the motion control, coverage control, and optimisation problems of a sensor network. In my study, to establish the swarm intelligence of multi-agent systems, the reinforcement learning paradigm and Kalman filtering method with consensus protocol are employed.</p>
