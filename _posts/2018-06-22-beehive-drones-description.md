<p align="justify">In 2015, I decided to apply for the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) to support my doctoral study at The University of Manchester. In the application process, all applicants, including me, of course, have to submit an essay to elaborate on what I, as an awardee, will do after completing my study -- an essay to explain my future contribution to Indonesia. Inspired by my research topics which I did focus on in my bachelor study and videos I watch on YouTube about Boston Dynamics, I wrote an essay about my dream of building an aerial robotics laboratory in Indonesia. I imagined that Indonesia has a laboratory that hopefully becomes a research centre for those interested in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) collaborate and produce an easy-to-operate UAV to help people.</p>
