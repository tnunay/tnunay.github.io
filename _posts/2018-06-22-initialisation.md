<!-- Social media have become part of our lives. In fact, most people in my circle have at least one social media account and share their almost-daily life on, for example, their Facebook and Instagram story. -->
<p align="justify">
This personal website was initially created in Belfast, 19 June 2018, to replace my social media accounts in the future - where I can share my thought and view regarding an issue, my projects, and works, without having too many social media accounts.
